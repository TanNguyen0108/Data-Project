## Collect Data

Get data from the factory in the form of xml, based on the code we can determine where the data needs to be analyzed. Using this sample data: [DATA](https://github.com/TanNguyen0108/Data-Project/tree/main/Machine%20Tolerance%20Data%20Analyzing%20for%20Batch%20Manufacturing/DATA)

## Code

Please reference this code to inspect detail: [CODE](https://github.com/TanNguyen0108/Data-Project/blob/main/Machine%20Tolerance%20Data%20Analyzing%20for%20Batch%20Manufacturing/Main_Code.py)

## Data cleansing:

Data cleansing involves various step on this project: Removing duplicates, Handling missing data, Correcting inaccuracies, Dealing with outliers, Validating data.

Data cleansing, also known as data cleaning or data scrubbing, is a crucial process in data analysis and preparation. It involves identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset to ensure the data is accurate, reliable, and suitable for further analysis.

In the context of this project, data cleansing plays a vital role in preparing the collected data from the factory's product dimension measurements. The automated tool developed in this project will employ various techniques to address data issues commonly encountered in such datasets.

The data cleansing process will include removing duplicates to eliminate redundant records. It will also handle missing data by either imputing appropriate values or excluding records with missing information. Additionally, the tool will correct inaccuracies, such as typos, inconsistencies, or conflicting information, to ensure data integrity.

## Statistics

In this project, statistical analysis techniques are utilized to control and monitor the results. Several key methods are employed, including histograms, moving averages, control charts, and Pareto analysis.

Histograms: Histograms provide a visual representation of the distribution of data. By grouping data into intervals and displaying the frequency or count of observations in each interval, histograms allow for a quick assessment of the data's shape, central tendency, and variability. This analysis helps identify any significant deviations or abnormalities in the result distribution.

Moving Average: Moving averages are used to smooth out fluctuations and identify underlying trends in the data. By calculating the average of a sliding window of data points, moving averages provide a clearer picture of the overall pattern over time. This analysis helps to identify long-term trends and potential anomalies in the result data.

Control Charts: Control charts are effective tools for monitoring process stability and identifying variations or special causes. By plotting data points over time and setting control limits, control charts enable the identification of common cause variation and the detection of any out-of-control signals. This analysis helps in maintaining consistent and predictable results by taking appropriate corrective actions when necessary.

Pareto Analysis: Pareto analysis is used to prioritize and focus efforts on the most significant factors contributing to a particular outcome. By identifying and ranking the frequency or impact of different categories, Pareto analysis helps determine the vital few factors that account for the majority of the observed issues. This analysis assists in allocating resources effectively to address the most critical aspects that impact the overall result.

By leveraging these statistical analysis techniques, this project ensures rigorous result control. The combination of histograms, moving averages, control charts, and Pareto analysis empowers efficient monitoring, early detection of issues, and targeted corrective actions, leading to improved overall quality and performance.
